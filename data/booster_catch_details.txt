Super Heavy Booster Catch Mechanics - "Chopsticks" System
The Mechazilla tower arms (nicknamed "chopsticks") catch returning Super Heavy boosters mid-air.

Process:
1. Booster performs boostback burn (~48 seconds duration, 33 engines) to return to launch site.
2. Automated health checks on booster and tower must pass.
3. Flight Director sends manual "go for catch" command before boostback completion.
4. Booster hovers using 13 center engines during final descent.
5. Chopstick arms close around booster grid fins and hardpoints.
6. Catch demonstrated first on IFT-5 (October 2024) with Booster 12.

Advantages over legs:
- No landing legs needed → lighter booster, more payload.
- Immediate return to pad for inspection/reflight.
- Reduces risk of tip-over on uneven ground.

Future: Ship catch planned for 2026+ with Block 2 vehicles.
