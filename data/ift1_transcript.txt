Starship Integrated Flight Test 1 (IFT-1) - April 20, 2023
Vehicle: Booster 7 / Ship 24
Launch site: Starbase, Boca Chica, Texas

Timeline:
T-00:00:00 - Liftoff with 33 Raptor engines on Super Heavy booster.
T+00:00:27 - Max Q (maximum aerodynamic pressure).
T+00:01:30 - Multiple Raptor engine failures begin on booster (3 engines out by T+1:45).
T+00:02:50 - Stage separation attempt fails; vehicle begins uncontrolled tumble.
T+00:03:59 - Flight Termination System (FTS) activated; vehicle destroyed over Gulf of Mexico.

Key events:
- All 33 engines ignited at liftoff, achieving full thrust for ~20 seconds.
- Booster reached altitude of ~39 km but did not separate from Ship.
- No boostback burn attempted due to early failures.
- Root cause: Propellant leaks and fires in engine bay led to loss of attitude control.

Objectives achieved: First integrated flight, pad clearance, initial ascent data.
Objectives missed: Stage separation, boostback burn, controlled landing.
